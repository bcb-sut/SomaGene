# SomaGene 
  
  
## Installation 
  
The following R packages are required:
  * [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table)
  * [GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html)
  * [IRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html)
  

Clone the package from the github page in the directory DIR
```
git clone https://github.com/bcb-sut/SomaGene.git DIR

```
Then install the SomaGene using R function `install.packages()`

```r
# Install SomaGene from source
install.packages("DIR/SomaGene_src", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Usage

First you should import the SomaGene library

```r
library(SomaGene)
```

Then you should read your input data (for example your gene list)
There's a small test data in github.

```r
table <- fread("DIR/test_data/test_table.tsv")
```

The dataset should contains four columns, ID, chromosome, start, and end.
For example the forrmat of test_table.tsv is like below:

| GeneID  | chr | start | end |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ENSG00000223764	  | chr1  | 845735 | 864616 |


**The values of chromosome column should have the format of ['chr' + number of chromosomoe] like chr2 or chrX**

There is a 'Fantom5_enhancer_phase1and2.txt' file for testing.
   
```r
annot <- fread("DIR/test_data/Fantom5_enhancer_phase1and2.txt")

# Then you run the annotateBinary function
